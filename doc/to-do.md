## 21 April 2018

- send.cmd loop to trigger display of queued messages
- weather implementation
- remote managemenet strategy - a custom Arch distribution image with a config script? make a list of the things that would need to be managed... could they be fetched remotely from a central server, and just require that the end user be able to 1) install an image 2) connect it to wifi or ethernet
- list of what they need to be able to do and what we do
